The New York City Taxi and Limousine
Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the
agency responsible for licensing and
regulating New York City's Medallion
(Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles
(community-based liveries, black cars and
luxury limousines), commuter vans, and
paratransit vehicles.
Over 200,000 TLC licensees complete
approximately 1,000,000 trips each day.

The main purpose of Our project is to build 
Machine Learning model which can predicts the 
trip duration of taxi in New York City.
